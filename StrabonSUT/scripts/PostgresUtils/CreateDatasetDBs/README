Use these scripts to create the postgres databases for the real world, synthetic and scalability datasets.
The scripts also contain a commented command which can run, if desired, a validation query on the database, after the creation step.
For large datasets, such as Scalability 100M, 500M please download and use the StrabonLoader utility, instead of the createAllStrabonScalabilityDBs.sh script.
